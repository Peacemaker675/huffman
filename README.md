# Huffman Coding-based File Compression Web App
This project is a web-based file compression and decompression tool using the Huffman Coding algorithm. It allows users to upload files for compression and decompression, leveraging an efficient implementation written in C++ while using Flask for the backend.

## Features
### File Compression:
  Compresses input files using the Huffman Coding algorithm.
### File Decompression: 
  Decompresses previously compressed files.
### User-Friendly Interface:
  Web-based UI for ease of use.
### Seamless Integration:
  Combines Flask (Python) with C++ executable programs.
## Technologies Used
C++: Implements the Huffman Coding algorithm for compression and decompression.
Flask: Serves as the backend framework to manage file uploads and process requests.
HTML/CSS: Frontend for the web interface.
